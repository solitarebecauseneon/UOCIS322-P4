Description: Simple web application that calculates ACP-sanctioned brevet open and
close times based on current standards of the ACP association. flask_brevets handles
API interaction, calc.html is the primary page of the website. acp_times.py implements
the necessary logic for calculation open and close times, and acp_times_test.py is
a number of test cases that ensures acp_times.py works. All test cases pass as of
this version.
